""" LEXF : Enumerating k-mers Lexicographically
Given two strings s and t having the same length n, we say that s precedes t in the lexicographic order
(and write s<Lext) if the first symbol s[j] that doesn't match t[j] satisfies sj<tj in A.

Given: A collection of at most 10 symbols defining an ordered alphabet, and a positive integer n (nâ‰¤10).

Return: All strings of length n that can be formed from the alphabet, ordered lexicographically (use the
standard order of symbols in the English alphabet).
